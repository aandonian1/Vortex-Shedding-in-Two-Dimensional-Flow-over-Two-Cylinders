# Vortex-Shedding-in-Two-Dimensional-Flow-over-Two-Cylinders
this repository houses the configuration files for a 2D simulation of flow past two cylinders in COMSOL


Here is the youtube link of the playlist that goes through how to setup the model in COMSOL:
https://bit.ly/alan-ModelSetup-Tutorial

The results of the parametric sweep for two cylinders at Re of 7000 can be found in the following directory:
Vortex-Shedding-in-Two-Dimensional-Flow-over-Two-Cylinders/two cylinder turbulent sweep/post processing/

Also included is the matlab live code (.mlx) used to get the power spectra and the Strouhal number (more detail in the videos).
